Personal portfolio Sanne van der Loo
On my personal portfolio website, I want people to be able to get to know me and my work experience a little better. This website should be a tool for me to use when I am applying for jobs or when increasing my network. 
The website is a onepager where you can scroll or click on the navigation bar to the page you want to see. 
A next version would include a contact form that actually sends an email to my emailadress and a work page with more relevant work and explainations about it.
